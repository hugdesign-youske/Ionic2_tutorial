#Installing Ionic

## Ionic2_tutorial
`$ npm install -g ionic cordova`

## Once that’s done, create your first Ionic app:
`$ ionic start cutePuppyPics --v2`

### Omit –v2 if you’d like to use Ionic 1. To run your app, `cd` into the directory that was created and then run the `ionic serve` command to test your app right in the browser!

`$ cd cutePuppyPics`
`$ ionic serve`
